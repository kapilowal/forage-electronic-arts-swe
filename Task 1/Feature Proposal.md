# Feature Proposal: Meal Prep Subscription Kit

## Overview

The Meal Prep Subscription Kit feature allows Sims to subscribe to a weekly delivery service that provides fresh ingredients and recipes for meal prep. Sims receive a box containing all the necessary items to create a variety of dishes, making it easier to manage their daily meals and focus on other activities.

## Value Statement

Introducing this feature adds a new layer of convenience and realism to the game, reflecting modern real-life trends in meal planning. It enhances gameplay by simplifying the cooking process, making it easier for busy Sims to maintain a healthy diet and freeing up time for other pursuits. The feature also appeals to players who enjoy managing their Sims' daily routines and promotes culinary creativity by introducing new recipes.

## Solution

The Meal Prep Subscription Kit integrates seamlessly with existing food and cooking mechanics. Sims can order the kit through the computer or phone, similar to ordering groceries. Upon arrival, the kit can be unpacked to reveal a selection of meal ingredients and recipes. These recipes would be exclusive to the subscription service and could range from quick snacks to gourmet meals. The cooking process would remain the same, with Sims following the provided recipes to prepare meals. Additionally, the kits could cater to various dietary preferences, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, or high-protein options, adding more depth to the food system.

## Evaluation Statement

The Meal Prep Subscription Kit offers numerous benefits, including convenience, new recipe variety, and enhanced time management. However, there are potential downsides, such as reducing the challenge of managing a Simâ€™s cooking skills and the possibility of the feature becoming repetitive. To mitigate this, the kits could include random surprise ingredients or limited-time seasonal recipes, keeping the experience fresh and engaging. Overall, the feature would enrich The Sims 4 by reflecting real-life meal planning trends, enhancing gameplay through convenience and creativity.
